# multilayer_perceptron
This is a multilayer perceptron done using 7 layers and predicting outcome. It is trained on exchange rate data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/cfchan/hourly-gbpusd-w-technical-indicators-20002019#Column_Description_USDGBP.csv).
The prediction is then compared with random forest and linear model. Everything is trained based on technical indicators from previous days.
